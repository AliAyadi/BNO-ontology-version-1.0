BNO ontology Version 1.0 
============================================
The BNO ontology is proposed for understanding the behaviour of complex biomolecular networks and their transittability.
The BNO ontology is freely available at https://github.com/AliAyadi/The-Biomolecular-Network-Ontology.
The BNO ontology is a set of classes for the analysis and the description of complex biomolecular networks and their different components.
The BNO ontology has been aligned and merged with different ontologies such as the Gene Ontology, The Simple Event Model Ontology and the Time Ontology. This ontology matching among all these ontologies provides the necessary concepts needed for describing the transittability of complex biomolecular networks.
The BNO ontology can also be matched with the Gene Regulatory Ontology.
The BNO ontology has been applyed to three case studies (i) the Bacteriophage T4 gene 32, (ii) the phage lambda and (iii) the p53 signalling network.

System Requirements
===================
Windows:
========
The BNO ontology is designed to run on Windows 8/10 as well as a 64-bit machine. 
The BNO ontology will require about 40 MB of disk space, the Protégé software
and both reasoners Hermit version 1.3.8.413 and Pellet reasoner version 2.2.0.
